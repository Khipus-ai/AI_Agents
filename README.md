# AI_Agents
In the Artificial Intelligence Agents and Final Project (AI Hackathon) module, participants will explore the evolution and impact of AI in transforming processes and business models. The module will cover how to identify strategic opportunities for implementing AI projects, using tools such as the Business Model Canvas and the Balanced Scorecard to align use cases with organizational objectives. Emphasis will be placed on justifying AI initiatives through return-on-investment analysis, risk assessment, and tangible benefits, preparing students to lead high-impact projects across various sectors.

In addition, the module delves into the design, implementation, and orchestration of AI Agents, exploring both single-agent and multi-agent architectures, as well as frameworks such as OpenAI Agents, LangGraph, and Semantic Kernel. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) will be introduced as a standard for integrating LLM-based applications with external tools and data, fostering scalability and interoperability. Students will apply this knowledge in an AI Hackathon, where they must address real-world business or social impact challenges, develop functional prototypes, justify their feasibility, and defend their projects before a judging panel based on criteria of innovation, impact, and ethical responsibility.
